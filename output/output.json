You might be at a 3Lp offer right now and struggling to make ends meet. You might have crossed the 10 LPA mark, but you still want more savings, more investments. And if you're amongst the lucky few who make more than 25 LPA, you still feel like there's something missing. Somehow, new problems keep appearing. You see these people on the Internet flexing 50 LPA offers or having a 150k remote job and you wonder, what exactly is the difference between a 3 LPA offer and a 50 LPA offer? What do high earners do differently? Today, we're breaking it all down in this video. I'm sitting down with real people of various salary brackets, trying to understand what problems they face on a day to day basis. What separates a high earner from the rest, and most importantly, how can you move up the ladder? Because here's the hard truth. Most people plateau in their careers. They stay stuck at a specific salary range and it's really hard to break out of it. They don't know what exactly moves the needle. So. So if you want to break out of the 3 LPA trap scale beyond 10 LPA or even if you want a 50 LPA offer, this video is for you. Let's get started. I have mentored around 100 people to high paying remote jobs. By high paying I mean right out of college, around 10 LP as a remote offer or $1,000 a month. I have seen what separates someone at a 3Lp offer from someone at a 50Lpa offer. Usually the 3Lpa person is oblivious about what's happening all around. Thankfully, there isn't a lot of accountability in what you're doing. You're not an expensive resource to the company and hence there is a flywheel of you not getting valuable work, which leads to being stagnant in this company forever. The 10 to 12 LPA bracket is comfortable. In this salary bracket, people realize they're not at their full potential. What they're looking for is meaningful work that teaches them something new every day. They're less worried about doubling their salary immediately. They're more worried about learning new things because their bare minimum is sorted. And at 50 LPA you really reap the rewards of this whole process. There's a very high probability you're going to stay in that range, if not more. Companies value the work that you provide. You have a lot of leverage when you're interviewing and you also have a lot of accountability in your current team. This leads to a fairly comfortable lifestyle. And if you look at the polar opposites here, 3 LPA versus 50 LP or a CR. There's a stark difference in interest towards computer science. You'll see Arpit stock very soon who makes 1.3 cr from India. You'll also see Siddharth who makes 1.2 lpa or 10k a month. Notice the difference in their interest towards computer science and you have your answer right there. How many people got selected? Just me. Oh. Oh, very cool. Got it. Makes sense. So culture. How many people code from my class? I would say around 4.4people code in a batch of. And what do they teach? What's your syllabus? Okay. Oh boy. 1.3 cr. You're the rich guy here. Your salary progression over the years and then in this company. So my salary progress. So I start the salary that I got as a fresher was 2 lakhs a year. So I started with 2 lakhs a year, 20, 20k a month and then it became 6 lakhs. And then I joined a startup, Games up very. It was a great startup. I mean it was a career changing thing for me because again it was a startup. We were a small team, we had to raise rounds, we had to build products from scratch. And I was. And a bunch of engineers were responsible to deliver everything. Let's kick things off with the 3 to 5 LPA bracket. Siddhant makes 1.2 LPA. He's currently in college, so that's fine. Anshul makes 6 LPA. He's been working for around three years and he started at 4.5 LPA three years ago. The common challenges they mentioned were not being challenged every day. Extremely high notice periods, a lot of uncertainty if they put in their notice and a lot of times if they do get a job, they're not able to join because of a three month notice period. They also lack exposure to high quality projects. In the end, a consult is going to make you eight hours a day and barely will you get time for yourself. Every job leads to complacency. But I think the complacency should be deferred until you have at least 10 to 20 LPA offer. If you're currently stuck in a consult making 5 LPA, even though they are working you to the bone for eight hours a day, it's a good idea to take out time. You need this more than anyone else to build a lot of projects and high quality projects. A Lot of times your exposure is limited to a very niche stack, something like a Java or a PHP or ASP Net, and the gap between you and a skilled engineer will keep on widening as the years go by. And at some point you will not be able to justify three years of experience with the skills that you have. Another thing I saw was a very unclear roadmap of what to learn, where to apply. A lot of times lack of motivation to apply, which again I think will pull you down a death spiral that you don't want. Make friends in product companies. Move out of the consultancy bubble to understand what's happening, what are the kind of interviews that are there and start preparing. That's the easiest way to escape this trap is to somehow reach a product company or a FAANG that let's move the next salary bracket the 12lpa salary bracket 1lakh a month. This is where most people in Super 30 landed as well. There are two ways to reach here. Either you're a fresher and in which case this is a decent offer to start with. And if you're not a fresher then a lot of times after 4, 5, 6 years of experience in a consult or otherwise you reach this specific stage. Take a few names. Sanjeev, who's in Super 30 according to quicksas at a 15 LPA offer and he's currently in college, he hasn't even graduated. And arif, who has two years of experience joined Dropstation for a 12 LP offer. Both of them now have similar types of challenges that I'm going to talk about now. A lot of times when you're in this salary bracket it's not necessary, you know much more than someone who's making 5 LPA. It's just that you reach the right company at the right time. So one common challenge I saw was people were themselves not very confident about themselves. They weren't actively interviewing for that SD2 role, SD3 role in their company as well. They were doing a bunch of mundane tasks that was making them a little cribby. This is the level at which complacency hits because you're making mildly more than average. None of your non tech friends are making this much and you have a very cushy job. So beyond this luck will not favor you too much. If you want to break out of the salary bracket you need to get your fundamentals right. One solid thing you can do over here is take a lot of accountability. Now you're being paid a fairly handsome salary to code. That is something people yearn for for the longest time I underpaid myself, slash, took very low paying projects because I wanted to learn a new technology. You now have the opportunity to have a mildly cushy lifestyle, yet code on a day to day basis for eight to 10 hours. Use that effectively, provide a lot of value to your company. One of two things will happen from there. Either you will grow up the ranks of your company very quickly. That happened with Arpit who started at 2lpa, then moved over to 26lpa in an India based company. Sure he makes 1cr right now, but his 2lpa to 26lpa transition happened in an India based company because he was providing a lot of value. Boy 1.3 cr, you're the rich guy here. The salary that I got as a fresher was 2 lakhs a year and then it became 6 lakhs and then I joined a startup. In that startup I started with 6 lakhs and then I moved on to a package of 26 in a span of three years. But what steps are you taking to, you know, increase your pay further from here? So for the past one year I was not doing anything. I was just enjoying, just doing, focusing on my work. As you can see, behind that I have a bunch of things that I've written that I need to do. So basically you can write a prompt and you can get an app out of the AI, right? But in order to do that, you need to have a very, very, very good understanding of the fundamentals. So I'm revisiting all the fundamentals, focusing on system designs. So a lot of times you don't need a fancy remote job, you don't need a fang. You just need to make sure you're being accountable, growing up the ranks, leading teams eventually. And that will help you break out of this 10 to 12 LPA mark. Anything beyond this is usually either inflation helping you reach there or your skills and accountability. The first one is out of your control, the second one isn't. If you are looking for that 50 LP offer, it's just putting in the hours every day and thankfully now you're getting paid for it. Of course there's one thing I heard a lot of people say which was, unfortunately I'm constrained to a specific tech stack. I'm not able to spend time learning anything outside it. And this is one place, unfortunately you have to put in efforts. If your company is not letting you grow, you have to find some peers, some code base that you can contribute to that's outside of your scope of work. And learn through that or just spend a lot of time on open source code basis. The minimum requirement expectation I have at this scale is you do like to code. You can read through code bases. You're not just writing your own code, but reviewing code, looking at other people's code. So if that has happened, why not showcase your skills at a global level? Why not contribute to a library that a lot of people are using? That will give you enough leverage. That will give you one, a lot of leverage. Two, maybe that company only hires you, but but much more than that. You will understand where you stand. A lot of people are in this game, 10 to 12 LPA scale. But who's better than the other? You can define that by showcasing your skills in open source. So one strong suggestion to everyone, not just in this salary bracket, would be to showcase your skills in open source. It'll humble you if you're not good or it'll make you super proud if you are right. The last salary bracket, the cushy one 25 lpa plus we have fifth who makes 1.3 cr a year. The common challenges here are I'm earning well, but what next? Usually when you're making this much, you don't really need advice from someone on the Internet. You know what you're doing. But the common traits I saw were some level of burnout, which is expected considering you're being valued as such an expensive resource. I didn't see a lot of challenges for people in this specific salary range. The challenges were very first world. For example, I'm making one, how do I reach two? Or there is this other friend of mine who's currently at 2, what am I missing? Why can't I reach there? And a very focused roadmap to reach there. Like everyone was preparing for interviews here, which is expected. Like a lot of people in this salary range are also preparing. You would expect them to be complacent, but they're not. They're very happy with their work, their company is very chill. Usually there's a lot of ownership and you're usually the one hiring other engineers and interviewing constantly. But other than their day to day work, I saw a lot of them focusing on system design because that's part probably what's going to be asked in their next interview. They usually have a lot of leverage. Whenever you're joining a company at this specific salary bracket, the company has vetted you enough to make sure you're providing more value. And if you're providing value of 30, 40, 50 LPA or a CR, you're very ingrained into the system very quickly. In a year or two, any other engineer of the same skill set, if they join, they will not be able to provide as much value as you. Even if they work there for six months. It'll take them a ramp up period of at least six months to reach your level of productivity. So at this point the company really wants to retain you. That leads to pretty solid salary bumps. For example, Arpit, when he started in this company started at 70 lakhs but currently makes almost twice of that in a span of three years. You wouldn't expect such level of growth in a standard startup or a startup that hired you by mistake and you know you weren't providing as much value to them. It is at this stage that the rich just keep on becoming richer. You reach the top of the pyramid where there isn't enough crowd and hence the supply demand arbitrage kicks in and you know you keep renegotiating better and better either with the same company or others. It's the cushy pyramid top that you want to reach. Does it involve luck? A little bit, but not too much. If you're good, if you have experience, if you've worked for a few years and during these years you've provided value to a company that has led to you having a lot of experiential learning, which is underrated. Experiential learning is much better than theoretical course, YouTube clone learning. Everything else will just be an outcome. It's usually a lot of fun talking to these people as well. And this isn't super experience related. You could have less experience. I know 19 year olds who make similar amounts. It's more about a lot of CS intellect. Like they are 19 year olds but they've been coding for four, five years. So yes, the coding experience does matter, but the number of experience you've spent in the industry or how many years ago you graduated doesn't matter as much. Generally if you are in this third category, if you're in the lower end of it, which means 25 LP or 20 LPA, I would suggest starting to at least freelance. It's a whole different world out there which you don't really see. If you're in a in a very specific on site job in a product company or otherwise, you could totally be happy with what you're doing, but I would just urge you to try it once. The kind of options you might be able to get because of ppp, that stands for purchasing power Parity would just be something you might not have imagined. And you'll see the work life might be chiller, the number of hours you might have to put in would be less. You can work from home remotely, you can save a lot of money in taxes. And all of this just happens like this. You aren't really providing any more value, you aren't any more skilled. It's just purchasing power parity that's helping you. So for everyone who's stuck in this stage of 20-50 LP and wants to move beyond that, a managerial role is one, a leadership role is one, or the third one is getting a remote job. All three of these would help you break across this stage. And after that, even I am unsure. How do you make more than 1.52 cr a year? Probably the only way there is getting really good at a very niche skill that's very hard to hire for. I'll take an example. Sean Dubois, who's the founder of Bion, which is a WebRTC implementation of Golang. It's an open source project which he built for years and there were hypes and crests in the WebRTC market, but he recently got into OpenAI and I'm sure he's, you know, making much more than this though. The last sort of end game here is becoming a research engineer or probably joining an hft. That's, you know, that's something you're free to explore. But for most of US Commons, hopefully you understand what you can do if you're in the 3 LPA bracket, 10 LPA bracket or 25 LPA bracket, how can you break out of this? And what are the actionable things that you should do today to prepare for your next jump? With that, we'll end it. I'll see you guys in the next one. Bye.",
  "Summarization": "This video explores the common struggles and aspirations related to salary, examining what constitutes a \"good\" salary across different income levels.  From the challenges faced on a 3 LPA salary to the persistent desire for more even at 25 LPA or above, the video investigates the factors influencing career progression and income.  The creator interviews individuals across various salary brackets to understand their daily challenges and uncover the key differences between lower-paying jobs (e.g., 3 LPA) and high-paying roles (e.g., 50 LPA).  The video also addresses the common issue of career plateaus, offering insights and potentially strategies for breaking through salary barriers.  Drawing on experience mentoring around 100 individuals into high-paying remote jobs, the creator shares their observations on the factors separating those earning 3 LPA from those earning 50 LPA.\n",
  "Notes": "Topic: Defining a \"Good\" Salary\n\nWhat constitutes a \"good\" salary is subjective and depends heavily on individual circumstances, including location, cost of living, lifestyle expectations, and financial goals.  A salary considered \"good\" for someone in a rural area might be insufficient for someone in a major city.  The definition also shifts over time as inflation impacts purchasing power and individual needs and desires change.  Moreover, a good salary isn't just about the numerical value; it encompasses factors like job satisfaction, work-life balance, benefits, and opportunities for growth. Finally, comparing salaries solely based on numbers without considering the full context can be misleading.\n\n* Factors influencing salary perception: Location, lifestyle, financial goals, and inflation.\n* Subjectivity of \"good\" salary: Varies based on individual circumstances and aspirations.\n* Beyond the number: Job satisfaction, work-life balance, and benefits are crucial.\n* The impact of inflation: Purchasing power changes over time.\n* Comparative analysis: Need to consider the complete picture beyond the numerical value.\n\n\nTopic:  Career Plateaus and Breaking Through Salary Barriers\n\nMany individuals experience career plateaus, where their salary remains stagnant for extended periods.  This can be due to various factors, including lack of skill development, limited opportunities for advancement within their current role or company, insufficient networking, or a lack of understanding of market value and salary negotiation strategies.  Breaking through these barriers requires proactive steps, such as upskilling or reskilling, seeking out new opportunities, networking effectively to expand professional connections, and actively negotiating salaries during job searches or performance reviews.  Furthermore, a strong understanding of one's market value and the ability to articulate their contributions effectively are vital.  Mentorship can also provide valuable guidance and support.\n\n* Reasons for salary stagnation: Lack of skill development, limited opportunities, weak networking.\n* Strategies to overcome plateaus: Upskilling, networking, salary negotiation.\n* Understanding market value: Knowing your worth and communicating your contributions.\n* Importance of mentorship: Guidance and support for career advancement.\n* Proactive career management: Taking initiative to improve skills and seek opportunities.\n\n\nTopic:  The Difference Between Low and High-Paying Jobs\n\nThe substantial difference between a 3 LPA (lakhs per annum) job and a 50 LPA job often extends far beyond the numerical disparity in compensation. High-paying roles typically demand a more specialized skillset, advanced experience, and a proven track record of success.  These jobs often involve greater responsibility, leadership roles, and a higher degree of autonomy.  Furthermore, the benefits and perks associated with higher-paying jobs are frequently more generous.  Finally, the career trajectory and potential for future earnings are generally more promising in higher-paying roles.\n\n* Skillset and experience: Higher-paying roles require specialized skills and extensive experience.\n* Responsibility and autonomy: Increased responsibility and decision-making power in higher roles.\n* Benefits and perks: More comprehensive benefits packages in high-paying jobs.\n* Career progression: Higher potential for advancement and future earnings.\n* Demand and scarcity: High-paying roles often involve specialized skills in high demand.\n\n\nTopic:  High-Paying Remote Jobs and Career Mentorship\n\nThe increasing popularity of remote work has opened up opportunities for high-paying jobs across various sectors.  Finding and securing these positions often requires a specialized skillset highly sought after by companies,  strong online presence and networking, and effective communication skills.  A career mentor can provide invaluable guidance and support in navigating the job search process, honing one's skills, and negotiating salary offers.  Mentorship offers personalized advice tailored to individual needs and career goals.  Mentors can offer insights into industry trends, connect their mentees with relevant opportunities, and help them develop essential professional skills.  Effective networking is also crucial for discovering hidden job opportunities.\n\n* Skillset and demand: Specialized skills are crucial for high-paying remote positions.\n* Networking and online presence: Building a strong professional online presence.\n* Mentorship benefits: Personalized advice, networking opportunities, skill development.\n* Job search strategies: Utilizing various platforms and techniques for finding remote work.\n* Communication skills: Effective written and verbal communication for remote roles.\n\n\nTopic:  Savings, Investments, and Financial Well-being at Different Income Levels\n\nEven individuals earning substantial salaries (e.g., 25 LPA or more) can feel a sense of financial insecurity or a desire for greater financial well-being.   This feeling isn't necessarily related to the income level itself, but rather to individual financial goals, spending habits, and financial literacy.  The ability to effectively manage personal finances, plan for the future, and make informed investment decisions are crucial aspects of financial well-being, regardless of salary.  This involves understanding concepts such as budgeting, debt management, investment strategies, and long-term financial planning.   Financial education plays a crucial role in developing these skills and improving financial outcomes.\n\n\n* Financial goals and aspirations: Understanding personal financial objectives.\n* Spending habits and budgeting: Managing expenses effectively.\n* Investment strategies: Diversification and risk management.\n* Debt management: Strategies for reducing and eliminating debt.\n* Financial literacy and education: The importance of financial knowledge.\n",
